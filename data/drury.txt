Player: Cristiano Ronaldo
Commentary:
The man is a storybook all by himself. There is no work of fiction more fanciful. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer gives thanks again for the scattering of the magical dust available only seemingly to Cristiano Ronaldo, who can reach areas other footballers just cannot reach. Whose grasp of the improbable is utterly unique. And whose timing, whose maximizing of the moment, is unparalleled surely anywhere in the history of this game.
Commentary:
Cristiano Ronaldo scores again! What a legend!
His ability to find the back of the net is unmatched.
Commentary:
He plays off his left foot, he almost doesn't need a right foot - mind you, he can score perfectly well with his right foot - but he weaves through spaces that don't exist. He's like a slippery eel. They can't get hold of him. He sort of defies physics

He was beautiful ,he was the point of difference and he has always been the point of difference, unparalleled and maybe there is today and always will be those who argue and those who debates and the debate can rage on if you like  but as he falls in love with the object in the world his heart most desired it is hard to escape the supposition that he has rendered himself today,THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME

Commentary:
Pep's Manchester City, beaten in the Premier League for the first time in a hundred and twelve days amidst the sort of drama that is so rare as to be so precious...
Commentary:
Hotspur's game plan was spot without blemish. Man City are still the favourites but the league has not won. Anything is possible but not all are probable.
Commentary:
It is why we love our league and it is why today Manchester City who are still six points clear now. It is why Manchester City might not certainly win our league, IT'S A RACE AGAIN!!!!

Match: Manchester City vs. Leicester City
Event: Premier League, May 2019
Context:
In a titanic tussle for the title back in 2019, Manchester City knew only perfection would stop Liverpool claiming a first league title in nearly 30 years.
The Citizens, reigning champions at the time after amassing triple figures in terms of points, eventually went within touching distance of repeating that feat 12 months later, with their 98-point haul pipping the Reds to the post.
Therefore, every point mattered. And in early May, a stubborn Leicester City side were proving difficult to break down, with City requiring a victory to ensure they went into the final day in control of their destiny.
Goal:
City skipper Vincent Kompany - not exactly famed for his long-range shooting - took efforts into his own hands by unleashing a rasping 25-yard strike that ultimately led to Pep Guardiola’s side sealing a domestic treble.
And in typical fashion, Drury was on hand to narrate the dramatic moment a nervy Etihad Stadium was sent into raptures by the Belgian’s wondergoal:
Commentary:
Kompany... had a look, had a hit... ohhh! Captain fantastic! A wild celebration for a goal from his wildest dreams!
A fantasy goal for City’s fantasy footballer! A goal fit for a champion of all time!
He merely gives thanks. Around him, tens of thousands in blue give thanks for Manchester City’s man of men!


Match: Real Madrid vs. Arsenal
Event: UEFA Champions League, 2006
Context:
We're going all the way back to 2006 for this one as Arsenal attempted to ascend to the top of European football for the first time. They'd come awfully close, too, falling in the final to Barcelona after a heartbreaking defeat in Paris.
Indeed, Arsenal would go on to dispatch fellow European heavyweights Juventus and a talented Villarreal outfit on their way to a first-ever Champions League final.
However, the highlight of their run was surely the Gunners' victory over a star-studded Real Madrid in the first knockout round.
The Gunners would take the tie 1-0 on aggregate, with the crucial goal coming in Madrid courtesy of Thierry Henry.
A tense goalless draw at Highbury followed in what was Real Madrid’s one and only visit to the famous old ground, with Jens Lehmann’s heroics key to maintaining the north Londoners’ slender advantage.
Goal:
And looking back to that decisive moment in the first leg, it was a stunning display of brilliance from Henry as he showed strength and poise to tie Real's defense in knots. Drury delivered worthy commentary to sum it all up:
Commentary:
Here's Henry getting clear, it's Thierry Henry... he's scored! He's scored for Arsenal in the Bernabeu! No more, no less than they merit! Arsenal have been the thrusting force of this tie! Thierry Henry, the Gunner Galactico, it is Real Madrid nil, Arsenal one!


Event: Wayne Rooney's Bicycle Kick Goal
Match: Manchester United vs. Manchester City
Date: February 2011
Context:
Wayne Rooney produced some incredible moments throughout his glittering career, but one does manage to stand out amongst them all.
Goal:
It was an extraordinary hit late on in a clash that secured a massive result in the title race - one that United would go on to win. With Nani’s opener canceled out by Edin Dzeko’s deflected effort, it was up to Rooney to settle things, and his goal for the ages ensured United maintained their four-point lead at the top with 12 games to play.
Commentary:
Rooney! Oh, wonderful! What a goal! And what a time, in what a place! What a player! Wayne Rooney, out of this world! 2-1 United!


Event: Siphiwe Tshabalala's Historic Goal
Match: South Africa vs. Mexico
Tournament: 2010 FIFA World Cup
Date: June 2010

Context:
The 2010 World Cup might primarily be remembered for a very dull brand of football played to the sound of bored bees, but the opener delivered a truly historic moment.
South Africa, after all, were the first African nation to ever host the tournament as they kicked it off against Mexico in June 2010.
They have not featured on the global stage since their home World Cup, but there were certainly moments to savor.
Alongside the weight of being the continent’s first World Cup hosts, they also beat an albeit out-of-sorts France as the former world champions completely crumbled, even finishing below their unfancied opponents in the group.
Bafana Bafana were also unfortunate to exit the tournament by virtue of goal difference.
Nevertheless, they will always have one of the tournament’s most iconic strikes to their name, and despite not holding on for victory on opening night, their opener was undoubtedly one of the goals of the finals.
Goal:
So when Siphiwe Tshabalala put the hosts ahead with the tournament’s first goal, emotion completely took over the game. Drury did his best to capture that on commentary, with a call that summed up just how special the moment was. He even later proclaimed the match to be his favorite of his career:
Commentary:
It's Tshabalala... Goal Bafana Bafana! Goal for South Africa! Goal for all Africa! Jambulila, rejoice! Bafana Bafana have popped the first cork of their day of days!


Event: Kostas Manolas' Goal Against Barcelona
Match: AS Roma vs. Barcelona
Tournament: UEFA Champions League, 2018
Date: 2018

Event: Scott McTominay's Goal and Manchester United's Win
Match: Manchester United vs. Manchester City
Date: March 2020
Commentary:
A red-letter day, Scott McTominay, Ederson stay to hide, it's Solskjaer's day to look to Paradise and say I've done a double over the Neighbors.


Event: Eric Dier's Penalty Goal vs. Colombia
Match: England vs. Colombia
Tournament: 2018 FIFA World Cup
Context:
This was a moment that sent the nation wild with excitement. The words “England win on penalties” is something that wasn’t heard of since 1996 - but the Three Lions managed to do it on the biggest stage in international football.
Drury shouted, “history has been made for this new team, new territory,” as they hadn’t reached the quarter-finals since 2006. What a feeling and a symbolic choice of words.
Commentary:
History has been made for this new team, new territory.


Event: Cody Gakpo's Goal for the Netherlands
Match: Netherlands vs. Senegal
Tournament: FIFA World Cup, Qatar 2022
Context:
The first spine-tingling moment of Drury's commentary came as one of the breakout stars of Qatar 2022 broke the deadlock for the Netherlands against Senegal. Shades of ‘Wayne Rooney – remember the name.’
Commentary:
De Jong… Goalkeeper’s come and Holland lead… the Netherlands.
Gakpo is the name. A blur of youthful orange. The Dutch footballer of the year is the Dutch man of the moment.



Event: Argentina vs. Mexico, Do-or-Die Group Stage Clash
Tournament: 2022 FIFA World Cup, Qatar

Context:
Lionel Messi’s last dance has been the story of the group stage so far. There’s no man we’d rather listen to narrate Argentina’s ongoing psychodrama than the world’s most poetic football commentator.
Commentary:
Perhaps Argentina’s motto is – ‘it is not how you start, it is how you finish’
Not often in the World Cup’s stellar environment has one so mighty been rendered so vulnerable. Lose and Argentina are out.
Argentina and Messi the great marching here to stay alive. Feeling the heat, feeling the obligation, the unforgiving scrutiny, every lens, every eye on every touch and turn and wince and smile. There is nowhere to hide.

Match: Liverpool vs. Manchester United
Tournament: Premier League, 2023
Commentary:

Event: Chelsea's UEFA Champions League Victory

Event: Bukayo Saka's Penalty Kick for Arsenal
Match: Arsenal vs. Liverpool
Tournament: Premier League, 2022
Commentary:
Now this is one brave boy. Bukayo Saka. Because this is one pressure penalty. He has experienced pressure from the spot like few others. He has suffered for that pressure, but now the Emirates braces itself for perhaps a pivotal kick of the football.
These are broad shoulders. This is courage. A sporting moment in time. Bukayo Saka. Such poise! Such noise!

Event: Thierry Henry's Goal for Arsenal vs. Real Madrid
Match: Real Madrid vs. Arsenal
Tournament: UEFA Champions League, Last-16, 2006
Context:
The Santiago Bernabeu was silenced by an ethereal Thierry Henry as he burst past Real Madrid’s entire team to put Arsenal in front in the last-16 of the Champions League back in 2006. The Gunners became the first team to beat Los Blancos on their own turf.
Commentary:
It’s Thierry Henry. He’s scored. He’s scored for Arsenal, in the Bernabeu. Arsenal have been the thrusting force of this tie. Thierry Henry, the Gunner Galactico.


Event: Sergio Aguero's Title-Clinching Goal for Manchester City
Match: Manchester City vs. Queens Park Rangers (QPR)
Tournament: Premier League, 2011/12
Commentary:
Drama of the ultimate type! Tears of distress turn to tears of unbridled joy! It just does not get better than this. It will never get better than this in blue.
The blue moon has risen. Just like a dream in their hearts. Where does football go from here?” - After Sergio Aguero's goal secured the Premier League title for Manchester City in the 2011/12 season.


Event: Manchester City's Premier League Title Clinching Comeback
Match: Manchester City vs. Aston Villa
Tournament: Premier League, 2021/22
Commentary:
From the brink of despair, elation. How dare ye who thought they could relinquish the title on the final day. Four titles in the last 5 years for City. A blue-bound juggernaut textbook of buoyancy, the scintillating science of sports, precision engineering, stylish and glossy football. The stuff of stellar champions. Congratulations Man City, the Premier League champions 21/22.

Event: Mohamed Salah's Hat-Trick vs. Manchester United
Match: Manchester United vs. Liverpool
Tournament: Premier League
Commentary:
Henderson nicks it. Jota's one way, Salah's the other.
He's on an Old Trafford hat-trick here Mo Salah...and he captures the moment!
The man is extraordinary. The match is extraordinary. The scoreline is extraordinary.
That picture will be framed and kept forever by Liverpool fans all over the world.
Another Mo Salah hat-trick and this one - THIS one - at the expense of Manchester United, at Manchester United.
Commentary:
Ole Solskjaer has it to drink in. Has it somehow to interpret. Has it somehow to react to. His job feels impossible.
Commentary:
This for Manchester United was impossibly bad.


Event: Aaron Ramsey's Departure from Arsenal to Juventus
Match: Arsenal vs. Tottenham
